                        Science, Technology, Mathematics and Engineering are all linked together is a fundamental way.
                        The field of STEM is becoming more and more of a necessity rather than an accessory.
                        We are making new discoveries in science, which are explained using complex mathematics.
                        Technology is used to prove those theories, and with those theories comes appliable
                        appliances. Engineering is used to design and eventually build these structures, which can be later
                        used in this loop or somewhere completely different.

                        Our understanding of the universe has grown exponentially over the last few centuries. In
                        the ancient times, we never believed in science and instead believed in myths, the most
                        famous ones from Greece. Then, philosophy emerged and the first scientists began asking
                        scientific questions. Plotemy came up with the idea that Earth is at the centre of the universe.
                        At first, this seemed like the logical answer, however, as more and more accurate measurements
                        contradicted the model, the planetary model took over. Copernicus, Galileo and Kepler
                        showed that the Earth is not at te centre, but instead the Sun is. Isaac Newton revolutionised
                        how we think about gravity. However, small errors emerged in the theory of gravity and
                        so Einstein's Theories of Relativity restored those errors back to 0. It also predicted the
                        beginning of the universe, which we call the Big Bang. Quantum Mechanics explains the behaviour of particles
                        on the atomic level. Now we are at a stage where we need to create a theory of everything which
                        unifies both Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity. This is a very hard thing to do but there
                        has been progress.

                        The Earth was formed from a protoplanetary disk 4.5 billion years ago. It was a toxic world,
                        but all of that was going to change. Around 4.4 billion years, a frozen world, around the size of Mars,
                        collided with the Earth causing it to obliterate into pieces. But then a new planet emerged,
                        our Earth, and as it cooled, it had the conditions to start life. Now the Earth is teeming with
                        life and it has transformed the face the Earth. However, around 2 million years ago, a
                        new, intelligent species emerged. This species would later build architecture and start the chain
                        reaction to extinction. And it's still happening to this day. That species is the <i>homo sapiens</i>.
                        <br>
                        Mankind is currently causing an extinction event that will eventually kill all species on Earth, including a large amount of us, homosapiens . This is because of us hunting down and killing animals just because of their
                        resources. Moreover, marine fishing and deforestation are destroying not only the animals,
                        but the environment around it.
                        <br>
                        We need to do something about our planet, because so far this is our only home.
                        We need to take extra care of our planet and we want to make our planet the best
                        planet.

    <p style="padding-top:1%; text-align:center;">I am a student who believes that every student should be able to answer
    their questions about science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
    I believe that the world can be changed by this generation, and generations
        to come.</p>

    <p style="padding-top:1%; text-align:center;"> The world needs our help. It is us that decide the future.</p>
    <h2 style="padding-top:3%;">How am I changing the World</h2>
    <p style="padding-top:1%; text-align:center;">I and many other students with similar ambitions are working alongside our local
    council to change the future and make our urban environment more sustainable.
    We are conducting several sustainability projects across our neighbourhood,
    encouraging kids and adults to join us along. These projects include -
    </p>
    <ul style="list-style: circle inside;">
        <li>Using GPS trackers to monitor and save kangaroos</li>
        <li>Encouraging kids to walk to school by following a robot</li>
        <li>Monitoring the water quality in the Plenty River to save various wildlife species</li>
        <li>Monitoring how efficiently we are using rainwater</li>
    </ul>
